Weather app made with html, css and javascript using an API. How does it work?

![app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/731ff229-0808-45fa-a9c9-00fb5d03e920)

1. Input: Enter city name.
2. API Request: Fetch weather data.
3. Error Handling: Display error if city is invalid.
4. Display: Show weather details if valid.
5. On line 3 of script.js, make sure to insert your API key from openweathermap.org; otherwise, the app won't function.
